LineaDevice
===========

Linea Device plugin for cordova.

This is a fork from the original Allada Inc. repository to make it compatible with cordova 6.

The files from the Linea SDK have been removed and need to be added back manually. To get them you need to create an developer account with Infinite Peripherals (http://ipcprint.com/developer/). The files that need to be copied to the src folder are DTDevices.h and libdtdev.a.

This version of the code was tested with version 1.94 of the SDK.
